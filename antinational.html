				<p>The internet is not some sort of divine being that transcends politics, wordly matters, or anything else for that matter. It, as a product of human acticity, is subject to the same forces that we as humans are. There is no escape from the commodity online, if we want a truly free internet, we have to free the world first. However, what <i>is</i> special about the internet is that it plainly reveals the contradictions in many of these forces, and allows us to organize against them. I'd like to particularly discuss national borders and their (lack of) existence on the internet, and what we can do to ensure this phenomenon continues, and how we can use this mode of organization to remove these barriers to living free, complete lives in real life, as well as our cyber-existences.
