Shown to Humankind is the Ocean <br />
Its Depths of the Past in the Wisdom of the Light <br />
Glitter as gleaming waves <br />
lap up on the shores of the present. <br />
But unseen just below the surface <br /> 
dulled by the trash washing up <br />
another body awaits recognition <br />
When the tide is low <br />
and the brave undertake to wade <br />
the shoals of memory <br />
surface for us to find <br />
