			<b>2022-02-06 -</b> <p>Hey there Amelia (And whoever might be watching this) I have very little to update you on because frankly very little has been happening with rods. We were supposed to have a fun little DJ night but it got cancelled due to some crazy icy rain that made it just impossible to walk/drive. In any event, I hope I have more to give you next week, but we rescheduled that event for the 18th, which is a little while from now. We will have our Broken Hearted Open Mic soon, but that's gonna be a nightmare because of all the people that are gonna want to perform. C'est la vie et c'est la mort.</p>

			<b>2022-30-01 -</b> <p> Secret Santa Time! This is jack checking in with a Rods Update. Today is secret santa and here I am giving you your homemade gift, from the internet! Basically, I will keep this blog (which only you and anyone you give the link to has access to) updated with all the inside rods goss - stuff too juicy to be published maybe? :0 Anyway, Merry Merry, Jack </p></div>
